To run this, please create folders corresponding to the class names inside the directory your files are located. Currently this supports only Passports and Letter of 
Acceptance, hence you need to create Sub folders names 'Passport' and 'LOA'. 

You can then run the interface.py and brows the main directory your files are located. The app will automatically scan through the files, (png,jpg,pdf) and
make a copy to the relevant subfolder.
